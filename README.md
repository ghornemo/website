spring MVC website

A quite open-ended project that was used to gain some first-hand experience using Spring MVC and
external APIs(Google Maps, Google Auth, Twitter). 

Features:
1. View tweets from NA leaders; sticky interesting tweets; comment on pinned tweets.
2. Place orders for an online restaurant
3. Leave Ratings & Ratings on dishes in the restaurant (1-5, with optional comment)
4. Activity is tracked in account (orders placed, tweet history)
5. Either create account, or login with google account
